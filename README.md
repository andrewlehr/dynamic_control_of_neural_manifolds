# Dynamic control of neural manifolds
Andrew B. Lehr, Arvind Kumar, and Christian Tetzlaff

This code produces the figures from the preprint "Dynamic control of neural manfiolds", by Andrew B. Lehr, Arvind Kumar, and Christian Tetzlaff. Preprint available at: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.08.602452v1

To get started, create a virtual environment and download relevant libraries. All requirements can be installed with:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Each jupyter notebook reproduces a Figure or parts of a Figure, indicated by the file name.
For expected results, see Figures in notebook before running or see preprint.
Depending on number of simulations in each notebook, run time ranges from just a few seconds up to minutes.



Tested on:
Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS operating system on DELL Latitude 5520 with 11th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-1185G7 @ 3.00GHz × 8, with 32 GB RAM
